## Application Overview

The application is a comprehensive full-stack system driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), constructed using the Langchain framework, Python 3, and Flask for the backend. The primary purpose of this application is to retrieve and analyze information about individuals using a variety of web sources such as LinkedIn and Twitter.

### Backend Functionality

The backend of this application, built with Python and Flask, facilitates communication between the frontend and various web services. The frontend initiates a POST request to the `/process` route, providing a person's name as the parameter. This name is then employed in conjunction with the Search Engine Result Page API (SerpAPI) to uncover web links associated with the specific user.

Utilizing the SerpAPI, the application scrapes for links related to the user's LinkedIn profile and Twitter username. The LinkedIn profile scraping is conducted by the Langchain agent, while another agent is responsible for gathering the most recent Twitter posts associated with the user.

### Data Processing and Analysis

Once the relevant data is gathered, the GPT-3.5 model analyzes the collected information. The GPT-3.5 model performs data analysis and generates a serialized object, termed as PersonIntel, containing comprehensive information about the searched individual. This PersonIntel object is easily serializable to JSON thanks to the PydanticOutputparser, facilitating seamless data interchange.

### Response to Frontend

After processing the POST request, the backend sends a response to the frontend. This response includes the compiled data about the searched individual, enabling the frontend to present the collected information to the end-user.
